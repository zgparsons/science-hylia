Hello, world!

This is my site - I am Zachary.

I'll be posting the projects I make and some posts about my experiences as I progress through the process of learning to code. Some of this things I am learning about at the moment are:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) like fetch and service workers. 
* Netlify / Static Site Generators
  * [Eleventy / 11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) by [@zachleat](https://twitter.com/zachleat) and [Hylia](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/hylia) by [@hankchizljaw](https://twitter.com/hankchizljaw) - This site uses both of these!
