So Recently i have been watching Sci-Fi movies to name a few X-Men series, Cristopher Nolan movies and I feel that these films are way beyond our imagination of what science is but the movie that inspired me the most  is The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind, the good thing about this movie is, it's not a science fiction genre but it tells you how to use science for your needs

the Importance of science is uncompared and the main goal of humanity is to harness and perfect Science and move in the direction of good and Eco-friendly way, that's how we protect our mother Earth and also not exhausting all the available resources that feed humans and Animals

My quest is simple, I am here to share my knowledge of science particularly Physics, and Mathematics, though I am not a great student of mathematics i admire Mathematics the most as it is the driving force or the engine that runs the Vehicle called science.

I always admired the ancient science of different civilizations, especially the ancient Indian and the Greeks, because the science used by Ancient India is unmatched to its neighboring civilization for example usage of big numbers like shatha(100), sahasranama(1000), Koti(10 million), we cannot find usage of big numbers like in Greece and Romans and they found difficult to use numbers like these and many more .

currently, i am  researching about many Mathematicians and their theories and their impact on this world and in this series of blog posts we will discuss different mathematicians and rank them accordingly and we will find out who is the best and greatest Mathematician of all time, consider this work as a science journalist and We will explore many more theories in the future, thanks for Reading
