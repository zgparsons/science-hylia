```javascript
let name = 'Zachary'
console.log(`Hello World! I'm ${name} and this is my site`);
```

The site includes the projects I make and some posts about my experiences as I progress through the process of learning front end, back end and the javascript stack.

Some of the things I am learning about at the moment are:

HTML CSS / SASS

Templating engines for HTML - such as [.md](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and [.njk](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)

JavaScript

Node.js & Express.js

[Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) like fetch and service workers

Netlify / Static Site Generators:
