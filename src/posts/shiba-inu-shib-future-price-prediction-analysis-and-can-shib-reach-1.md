In this post, we are going to calculate the future price of the SHIB token and also the mathematical analysis of Shiba Inu, **SHIB** recently created a lot of Buzz in the Crypto Community and it continues to evolve from being a Meme token to a complete Vibrant Ecosystem which involve $SHIB, Leash, and Bone tokens as the central governing of Transactions and swaps, and already launching its first-ever Dapps called as the ShibaSwap, included features like Innovative Reward System when staking and swaps and Shiba Inu has already amassed 550k+ Community Members and Growing Fast day by day, which is a good sign for a Decentralized Ecosystem.

## [](https://5amblogger.com/article/shiba%20price%20prediction/#heading-so-what-exactly-are-shib-leash-and-bone)**so what exactly are SHIB, Leash, and Bone?**

**SHIB:**

the Primary Token, the Shiba Inu token, allows investors to store millions, billions, or even trillions of it in their wallets. with a total supply of 1 Quadrillion and out of which 50% Burned to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin for safekeeping. SHIB is the main reward they get if they provide liquidity or stake in Shibaswap.

**LEASH:**

LEASH was originally set to be a rebase token, but then they removed the rebase and unleashed its full potential. With a total supply of ONLY 107,646 tokens, it represents the other end of the SHIBA INU Ecosystem spectrum.

**Bone:**

Bone token is yet to release and it is stated that BONE takes the power of DeFi to the next level

### [](https://5amblogger.com/article/shiba%20price%20prediction/#heading-statistics-of-shib:)Statistics of SHIB:

Circulating supply : 497,730,966,630,395 (497 Trillions)

\ Market Cap : $4,607,895,073

\ Volume : close to $1 Billion($988,870,697)

\ Holders : 566,473

\ SHIB Price (29-06-21) : $0.0000950

Major Listings: Binance, Crypto.com, HitBtc, Huobi Global, etc

All-Time High: $0.00003791

#### Mathematical analysis of future SHIB Price:

Generally MarketCap= (Price of Coin/Token) * Total Circulating supply

so the Division of MarketCap and Total Circulating supply gives us the Price of Coin/Token

current Market Capitalisation of SHIB is $4,607,895,073 (4.6 Billion dollars)

1. so let's assume that Shiba gets to $40 Billion MC(achievable) then Price of SHIB would be ($40 Billion)/(497 Trillion) = $0.000080
2. so let's assume that SHIB goes to $100 billion MC (achievable)

   ($100 Billion)/(497 Trillion) = $0.00020

* so let's assume SHIB goes to MC of Etherium of $258 Billion

then Price would be ($258 Billion)/ (497 Trillion) = $0.00052

* so what if Shib goes to the Market cap of Bitcoins ATH MC of $1.5 Trillion

then Price would be ($1500 Billion)/ (497 Trillion) = $0.003

| MC in Billion | price     |
| ------------- | --------- |
| 40$           | $0.000080 |
| 100$          | $0.00020  |
| 258$          | $0.00052  |
| 1500$         | $0.003    |

So the ideal prediction price would be between $100 Billion and ETH's Calculation as SHIB is growing very strong and still new to the crypto world and promises to deliver real world use case projects like **SHIBASWAP** and many more expected to come

#### can SHIBA INU (SHIB) = 1$ possible, lets find out

![shiba inu 1$](https://5amblogger.com/article/shiba%20price%20prediction/null)

SHIB 1$ possible?

if ***SHIB*** goes to 1 $ then its Market Cap would be a staggering number and it will be 497 Trillion dollars and comparing MC, we get that Bitcoin's ATH MC is 1.5 Trillion Dollars, and Recently Microsoft Reached a milestone of Entering into $2 Trillion Market Capitalization alongside Apple and it took them 46 years to reach this huge number and for Apple, it took them 44 years to reach $2 Trillion clubs.

But that doesn't mean that to reach the $1 milestone for SHIB, Shiba Inu must have $497 Trillion MC, with less than $1 Trillion MC SHIB can reach a $1 milestone if the Circulating supply of SHIB tokens Burns organically through various transactions fees or with the help of ShibaSwap.

We don't know yet if they implement the burn functions or not, but with the addition of auto burn function, it's a win-win situation for SHIB tokens as it decreases the supply and increases the value SHIB Tokens, Devs are yet to announce the full functionality of Shibaswap and the inclusion of burn function

So whether Burn Function is added or Neglected only the future will tell, but SHIB is already outperformed other tokens in 2021 by giving more than 2 million % ROI, and Trade analyst expects that it continues to do so throughout the year and undoubtedly this year's best performer is SHIBA INU.

##### The true potential of SHIB is yet to come?

at first, they famously claimed as the True Dogecoin Killer, and as far as now SHIB has 566K Holders and meanwhile its Competitor Dogecoin has 4.1 Million holders which are almost 8 times bigger than SHIB, so there's a long way to go for SHIB to achieve the numbers of Dogecoin for SHIB, but the interesting thing about SHIB is its Volume just above $1 Billion and Dogecoin volume is $3 Billion, even though its holders are way lesser than dogecoin, but its volume is giving a tough competition to dogecoin which is a very positive sign for SHIB and Shiba Inu Project
