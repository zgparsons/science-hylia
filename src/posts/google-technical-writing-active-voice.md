## Active Voice

Sentences in technical writing should usually be written in active voice.

### How to Distinguish Active Voice from Passive Voice

<!-- Excerpt Start -->
In an active voice sentence, an actor acts on a target. In a passive voice sentence this formula is reversed.
<!-- Excerpt End -->
See the two formula below, followed by a basic example of each:

```javascript
Active Voice:
actor + verb + target
'The cat sat on the mat.'

Passive Voice:
target + verb + actor
'The mat was sat on by the cat.'
```

In each example the actor, the verb and the target remain the same:

```javascript
Actor: the cat
Verb: (was) sat
Target: the mat
```

The passive voice can also sometimes omit the actor. In this case the actor is unknown. Eg: `The mat was sat on.`

Omission of the actor can lead to a sentence being amiguous - in this case the reader is unaware of who sat on the mat. It may have been a dog, or any other animal. Good technical writing will be clear about who is doing an action.

### How to Recognise Passsive Verbs

A passive verb will usually be made up of __a form of *be*__ and the __past participle verb__. To make sense of that, you can break it down further:

- __A form of *be*__ will typically be:
    - is / are
    - was / were
- __The past participle verb__ will typically be the plain verb plus the suffix *ed*. Some examples are:
    - interpreted
    - generated
    - formed

There are also some irregular past participle verbs. In these cases the past participle form does not end with *ed*. Some examples are:
- sat
- known
- frozen

Some of the same examples as passive verbs are:
- was interpreted
- is generated
- was formed
- is frozen
- are known

If the phrase does contain an actor, a preposition ordinarily follows the passive verb. For example:
- was interpreted as
- is generated by
- was formed by

### Imperative Verbs are Typically Active

An __imperative verb__ is a command. Sentences that start with an imperative command are typically in active voice. They can often be confused as passive though because they do not usually contain an actor - however, the use of an imperative verb implies an actor. The implied actor is __you__.

A usual example of active voice with an imperative verb is in a list:

><small>1 - Open the configuration file</small>
>
><small>2 - Set the `Frombus` variable to `False`.</small>

### Use Active Voice More Often than Passive Voice

Active voice should be used most of the time. Passive voice should be used sparingly. Active voice has a few advantages for writers and readers:

- Most readers will mentally convert passive voice to active voice in order to better understand. Sticking to active voice removes this processing time for readers.
- Passive voice reports action indirectly. In doing so, it obfuscates the presented ideas.
- Passive voice can omit the actor altogether which forces the reader to guess critical information which could have been provided to them if the active voice had been used.
- Generally active voice is shorter than passive voice.
