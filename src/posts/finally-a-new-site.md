It's been awhile since I've had a personal site beyond my side-projects, and I've been wanting to change that for a while.

I started to think about it last year and quickly put together a little one-page placeholder site that's [archived here](https://5amblogger.com/archive/01/). Once I got the placeholder site out there I started trying to approach it as a "real" project rather than something I was just fiddling with. I made a ton of notes, and did a ton of research. I made a problem statement. I made a [Notion](https://5amblogger.com/posts/sampleblogpost/) board and filled it up with tasks, and then ignored it.

# I Will update this later
