👨‍🎓📈 Some of the things I am learning about at the moment are:

🧱 HTML

🎨 CSS / SASS

🧙‍♂️ JavaScript

🚂 Templating engines for HTML - such as [.njk](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/), and also using [.md](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to more easily write blog posts

👨‍💻 Node.js & Express.js

🛸 [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) like fetch and service workers

🔥 Netlify / Static Site Generators:[](https://www.11ty.dev/)

💻💪💥 [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) / 11ty by [@zachleat](https://twitter.com/zachleat) and [Hylia](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/hylia) by [@hankchizljaw](https://twitter.com/hankchizljaw) - This site uses both of these!
