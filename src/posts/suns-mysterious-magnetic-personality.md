**If we can use a compass on the surface of the Sun (hypothetically) and if the North pole of the compass points towards the geographical North pole of the Sun. When You repeat this experiment roughly after 11 years at the same place, the magnetic North pole of the compass points towards the geographical South pole of the Sun. This could be possible only if the Sun's magnet turns upward to down. How could such a thing ever be possible? The Sun rotates around its own axis and revolves around a particular centre in the Milky way, just like the planets. But there is no rotation that enables the Sun to move upwards down. Then how is the strange magnetic behaviour observed in the Sun? And the magnetic field on the surface of the Sun is not uniformly distributed and not constant in time. It changes continuously at every point on the surface of the Sun periodically; as shown in the butterfly diagram below, it was strange to note that this changing magnetic field at a point is seen, which is completely strange when compared to the magnetic field present on Earth. Why does the Sun exhibit a changing magnetic field, unlike Earth? What is the reason behind that?**

**Galileo Galilei was the initiator of the underlying science for these questions. He used to stare at the sun since he invented the telescope until he lost his eyes because of his madness in curiosity about the sun. but His madness of science was very helpful. He saw strange non-permanent spots on the surface of the sun, just like birth moles we have on our faces, as shown in the figure Magnetogram. He counted the number of sunspots present on the sun every year, month by month and recorded them. Since then, scientists have recorded the data and plotted a graph of sunspots versus time from 1610 to the present monthly basis, as shown in the figure Sunspots vs time.**
