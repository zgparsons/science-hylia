This is a post about my experience of completing the [Free Code Camp Certification - APIs and Microservices](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/).

There are also a group of posts on this blog about my experience completing the [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting in Javascript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/) too. Those posts can be found [here](/tags/intermediate-algorithms/).
