If we can use a compass on the surface of the Sun (hypothetically) and if the North pole of the compass points towards the geographical North pole of the Sun. When You repeat this experiment roughly after 11 years at the same place, the magnetic North pole of the compass points towards the geographical South pole of the Sun. This could be possible only if the Sun's magnet turns upward to down. How could such a thing ever be possible? The Sun rotates around its own axis and revolves around a particular centre in the Milky way, just like the planets. But there is no rotation that enables the Sun to move upwards down. Then how is the strange magnetic behaviour observed in the Sun? And the magnetic field on the surface of the Sun is not uniformly distributed and not constant in time. It changes continuously at every point on the surface of the Sun periodically; as shown in the butterfly diagram below, it was strange to note that this changing magnetic field at a point is seen, which is completely strange when compared to the magnetic field present on Earth. Why does the Sun exhibit a changing magnetic field, unlike Earth? What is the reason behind that?

Galileo Galilei was the initiator of the underlying science for these questions. He used to stare at the sun since he invented the telescope until he lost his eyes because of his madness in curiosity about the sun. but His madness of science was very helpful. He saw strange non-permanent spots on the surface of the sun, just like birth moles we have on our faces, as shown in the figure Magnetogram. He counted the number of sunspots present on the sun every year, month by month and recorded them. Since then, scientists have recorded the data and plotted a graph of sunspots versus time from 1610 to the present monthly basis, as shown in the figure Sunspots vs time.

Initially, people wonder why those spots exist. Later on, sunspots acted as a source for research to discover the Sun's necessary behaviours and magnetic properties. This graph shows a periodic rise to a maximum and a fall to a minimum in roughly around 11 years. (In the chart, a complete minimum of sunspots seen from 1645 to 1715 is considered Maunder minimum when very few sunspots are formed.) This trend even created more questions about the reasons behind such behaviour of the Sun.

George Ellery Hale (in 1908) discovered the presence of a strong magnetic field inside the sunspot by finding the Zeeman effect inside the sunspot. It was the first time consistently learning the existence of magnetic fields outside the Earth. This laid groundwork for the magnetic science inside the sun. A Magnetogram picture is a picture of the magnetism present on the surface of the Earth. The colours black and white are the negative and positive polarity of the magnetism, and the thickness indicates the degree of intensity of the magnetism present at that point. So the dark spots or white spots you see on the Magnetogram picture are indeed sunspots. You can notice sunspot has a higher magnetic field concentration than the rest of the surface. By this discovery, it was confirmed that the sun is a huge source of magnetic fields.

You can see the butterfly diagram of the magnetic field on the surface of the Sun. Y-axis indicates the latitudes, the x-axis indicates the time, and the thickness of colour indicates the magnetic field intensity. A surprising butterfly figure came out when this plot was made, as shown in the figure butterfly diagram.

All these things led to the understanding of new theories, put forth some crucial formulations of magnetohydrodynamics, and developed ideas of the poloidal field, the toroidal field inside the Sun. These are types of magnetic fields that we can see inside the Sun. A poloidal field is a field that is directed radially outwards from the Sun, and a toroidal field is a rotating field. This is the only place where you can see a field bent into toroidal shape because of the Sun's plasma moments.



A direct way to find out what is happening inside the Sun is impossible as we cannot go near the Sun in any way. If we try, we will be turning into plasma. So there was a problem in finding out an explanation for these questions. That's when Eugene Parker (in 1955) has an idea to develop solar dynamo theory to establish which could explain all the behaviour and properties of the Sun. This dynamic theory has answered many questions but could not solve the main problem, but his idea was worthwhile.



According to his model, just like a bar magnet magnetic field travels from South to North inside the sun. A phenomenon named differential rotation twists the straight poloidal field into a toroid shape and forms a toroidal field. Differential rotation is a phenomenon present at the bottom of the solar convection zone, located at a depth of 0.3 x radius of the sun. Because of this field facing balance, magnetic buoyancy sunspots are formed. It successfully explained the formation of sunspots and gave the idea of conversion of the poloidal field that is radial field into the toroidal field and vice versa. 



Later on, many such models were developed, and other phenomena were discovered and introduced, such as meridional circulation, which was not there in Parkar's dynamo theory. Many of the models didn't answer all the questions, and the research is ongoing in this field.



Plasma at the equator moves to the poles and from the poles to back to the equator; this phenomenon is considered meridional circulation. Due to resistive forces, this motion has to stop someday, but it is not stopping. This means something is acting as a source for meridional circulation. Many models haven't given proper explanations, but the flux transport dynamo model has an answer for this question. 



Flux transport dynamo is an important dynamo model that answers many questions about the sun's magnetism exhibited properties. Still, the original question has remained the same none of the dynamos have answered the question entirely
