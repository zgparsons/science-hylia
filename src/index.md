The site includes the projects I make and some posts about my experiences as I progress through the process of learning front end, back end and the javascript stack.

Some of the things I am learning about at the moment are:

HTML CSS / SASS

Templating engines for HTML - such as [.njk](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/), and also using [.md](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to more easily write blog posts

JavaScript

Node.js & Express.js

[Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) like fetch and service workers

Netlify / Static Site Generators: [Eleventy / 11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) by [@zachleat](https://twitter.com/zachleat) and [Hylia](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/hylia) by [@hankchizljaw](https://twitter.com/hankchizljaw) - This site uses both of these!
